# WhiteHouse-petitions
WhiteHouse petitions is an iOS app that shows White House petitions by fetching JSON file https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/petitions-1.json .
Data has been taken from the White House API in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift course.

⦿   Using Codable protocol    
⦿   Fetching data      
⦿   Parsing JSON feed      
⦿   UITabBarController       
⦿   UIStoryboard
